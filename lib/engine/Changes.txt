When cached the actor will be rendered only once to an off screen canvas, subsequent rendering will be of the cached version. note that the Size of the actor as specified by its properties will determine the size of the cached canvas area. In the case of unfilled actors, the allocated size will be slightly larger to allow for stroke thickness. Note that shadows and composite operations are not cached
